# Semi-Partitioned Fixed-Priority Scheduling on Multiprocessors

## Summary

This project is an implementation of the semi-partitioned fixed-priority scheduling algorithm on multiprocessors. The algorithm is described in the paper [Semi-Partitioned Fixed-Priority Scheduling on Multiprocessors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4840564). The algorithm is implemented in Python and tested on a simulator.
